\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:thesisoutline}
We organize the remainder of this thesis in the following manner.
In \chapref{chap:infuse} we will describe and discuss the \infuse system for comparing different feature selection strategies.
In \chapref{chap:prospector} we will describe and discuss the \prospector system for inspecting models via partial dependence plots.
Following, we will introduce the \emph{Model Diagnostic workflow}, aggregating instance-level explanations, in \chapref{chap:explainer} and discuss its capabilities in the context of binary input data.
Afterwards, in \chapref{chap:aggexplain} we will extend this workflow to numerical input data and explore its effectiveness compared to individually inspected instance-level explanations.
In \chapref{chap:summary}, we present a summary of the work while discussing key findings, implications, and open issues, leading to further research opportunities for future researchers.
Finally, in \chapref{chap:future_work}, we discuss the conclusions and future work.
