The extended interface to allow for non-binary data.
The list on the left shows the discovered ``decision sets".
Below that the distribution of prediction scores are shown.
A parallel coordinate view shows the instances covered by such a decision set (``expl 8") allowing non-binary input data.
The user highlights ``expl 10" showing its instances in purple.
