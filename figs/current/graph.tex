Node-link diagram showing how neighborhoods of data points are interconnected
with increasingly larger distances.
The edges of the directed graph always lead to points with a higher prediction score.
Especially of interest are label flips (ie., the prediction score increases by a wide
margin) or neighborhoods with consistent labels.
